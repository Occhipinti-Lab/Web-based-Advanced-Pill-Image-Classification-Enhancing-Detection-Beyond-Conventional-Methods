**Web-based-Advanced-Pill-Image-Classification-Enhancing-Detection-Beyond-Conventional-Methods**

This GitHub repository contains the data files and code for the Machine Learning model and Web application used in "Web-based Advanced Pill Image Classification: Enhancing Detection Beyond Conventional Methods".
The files are organised into two folders:

* Model: Containing all the image data and machine learning model code used in this project.
* WebApp: contains code for Web App.
* Requirements: There is a SystemRequirement.txt file in the Model folder containing this project's requirements.

The WebApp is currently hosted at: http://taharat.pythonanywhere.com/

For using the WebApp, please follow the steps below:
1. Select "choose file" and press "submit" to upload the picture.
2. The picture will be uploaded to the app, and the model will process it for classification.
3. The app will display the results to the users.

Use SystemRequirements.txt file in the Model folder for installing the required libraries.
